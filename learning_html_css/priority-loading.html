      <h2><code>dns-prefetch</code></h2>
      <p>Performs DNS resolution, so only useful for different origins.</p>
      <h2><code>preconnect</code></h2>
      <p>
        Performs DNS resolution, TCP connection, and TLS handshake. Only use this and
        <code>preload</code> for critical resources to avoid bogging down important downloads with
        establishing less important connections.
      </p>
      <h2><code>preload</code></h2>
      <p>
        Prioritizes downloading of a resource, but does not load it until referenced by other code.
        Ideal for preloading fonts or other assets that may not be discovered until later in the
        HTML.
