      <h1>Visibility</h1>
      <p>Hiding elements can be achieved in a few ways with different purposes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>display: none</code> - this fully remove the element from the DOM and is a good
          default, but be careful using this with animations/transitions
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>visibility: hidden</code> - this keeps the element in the DOM and document flow
            (i.e., there is still space held for it in the layout) but simply hides rendering it
            (useful for animations/transitions)
          </p>
          <p>NOTE: Also hides content from screen readers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>hidden</code> HTML attribute - <em>NOT </em> recommended since
          <code>display</code> values in CSS will override it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>content-visibility: hidden</code> - this is a very new CSS property and is not
          recommended at the moment, due to limited support.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </main>
  </body>
