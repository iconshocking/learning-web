    All BFC creation triggers:
    - The root element of the document (<html>).
    - Floats (elements where float isn't none).
    - Absolutely positioned elements (elements where position is absolute or fixed).
    - Inline-blocks (elements with display: inline-block).
    - Table cells (elements with display: table-cell, which is the default for HTML table cells).
    - Table captions (elements with display: table-caption, which is the default for HTML table captions).
    - Anonymous table cells implicitly created by the elements with display: table, table-row, table-row-group,
    table-header-group, table-footer-group (which is the default for HTML tables, table rows, table bodies, table headers,
    and table footers, respectively), or inline-table.
    - Block elements where overflow has a value other than visible and clip.
    - display: flow-root.
    - Elements with contain: layout, content, or paint.
    - Flex items (direct children of the element with display: flex or inline-flex) if they are neither flex nor grid nor
    table containers themselves.
    - Grid items (direct children of the element with display: grid or inline-grid) if they are neither flex nor grid nor
    table containers themselves.
    - Multicol containers (elements where column-count or column-width isn't auto, including elements with column-count: 1).
    - column-span: all should always create a new formatting context, even when the column-span: all element isn't contained
    by a multicol container (Spec change, Chrome bug).
    
    Flex & Grid containers similarly establish Flex/Grid formatting contexts

    They:
    - contain internal floats
    - exclude external floats.
    - suppress margin collapsing. -->
