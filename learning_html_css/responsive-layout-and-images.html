                One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers
                sat over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay,
                watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide
                chimney. Their names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were
                papermakers by trade, and were noted as possessing thoughtful minds
                and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of
                millions of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires
                without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.”

    <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/responsive-images-done-right-guide-picture-srcset/">Reference
        for this code</a>

    <p>This shows different resolution/widths of single image, and changes to a different image (due to art direction)
        depending on screen width, with the resolution of the cropped image depending on device pixel ratio (DPR).</p>

    <!--
    - <picture> is a container for multiple (usually) source elements and one REQUIRED img element
    - 'media' defines the breakpoints for each source 
    - 'srcset' defines images with their native widths or via device-pixel-ratio (DPR), which maps
      physical pixels to CSS pixels (NOTE: the 'sizes' attribute cannot be used when using DPR)
    - 'sizes' matches media queries with the intended DOM render size of image (which must be set
      via CSS), but the last value does NOT have a media query and is treated as the default. (NOTE:
      these values do NOT affect the DOM in any way - they only give hints to the browser about
      which image to serve for the current viewport.)
    - 'src' is fallback if 1) srcset attribute not supported or 2) when viewport falls outside
      defined breakpoints 
    - 'width' and 'height' provide the image's aspect ratio that the CSS engine uses to size the
      placeholder height of the image when it is not loaded if the CSS-defined width is responsive
      -->

    <picture>
        <source media="(min-width: 800px)"
            srcset="images/mona-higher-res.png 1980w, images/mona-mid-res.png 990w, images/mona-lower-res.png 495w"
            sizes="(min-width: 1600px) 75vw, (min-width: 1200px) 50vw, 30vw" width="1976" height="2940">
        <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="images/mona-high-res-crop.png 2x, images/mona-low-res-crop.png 1x"
            width="874" height="1072">
        <!-- all CSS and styling must be done on the img element - the other elements fo not
        actually take up space in the DOM -->
        <img class="mona-lisa" src="images/mona-higher-res.png" alt="The Mona Lisa">
    </picture>

    <h3>Always set <code><strong>width</strong></code>, <code><strong>height</strong></code>, and
        <code><strong>display:inline-block/block</strong></code> on images in HTML to calculate
        aspect ratio to preserve placeholder region for image 1) before loading and 2) if image fails to
        load.
        <br>
        (Added to browsers around 2021)
    </h3>
    <p>Additionally, (almost) always set <code>max-width: 100%, height: auto</code> to avoid the image possibly
        overflowing its container.</p>
    <p>This variant shows how space is always preserved in the DOM when following this advice.</p>
    <!-- <img>, like <source>, also supports 'srcset' and 'sizes' attributes -->
    <img class="mona-lisa" src="fake.png" alt="The Mona Lisa" srcset="fake.png 1980w, fake 990w, fake 495w"
        sizes="(min-width: 1600px) 75vw, (min-width: 1200px) 50vw, 30vw" width="1976" height="2940">
    </img>

    <p>This variant removes the width changes within a single image to show how it can create a
        smooth transition when only used to adjust resolution.</p>
    <picture>
        <source media="(min-width: 800px)"
            srcset="images/mona-higher-res.png 1980w, images/mona-mid-res.png 990w, images/mona-lower-res.png 495w"
            sizes="(min-width: 1600px) 75vw, (min-width: 1200px) 50vw, 30vw" width="1976" height="2940">
        <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="images/mona-high-res-crop.png 2x, images/mona-low-res-crop.png 1x"
            width="874" height="1072">
        <img class="mona-lisa smooth" src="images/mona-higher-res.png" alt="The Mona Lisa">
    </picture>

    <p>The <code>picture</code> element can also support fallbacks for unsupported images types (same as the
        <code>video</code> element for video).
