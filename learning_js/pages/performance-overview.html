              <li>
                Loading animations (w/ multiple parts if wait will be long) to

          </li>
          <li>
            <ul>
              Performance Measurements:
              <li>
                <strong>(Less useful):</strong> <dfn>First Paint</dfn> - when
                the first pixels render to the screen, such that it is clear the
                page is loading (not that useful of a metric).
              </li>
              <li>
                <dfn>First Contentful Paint <abbr title="">(FCP)</abbr></dfn> -
                when the user is able to consume first content (text, image,
                etc.)
              </li>

                  ><dfn
                    >First Meaningful Paint <abbr title="">(FMP)</abbr></dfn
                  ></span
                >

              <li>
                <dfn>Largest Contentful Paint <abbr title="">(LCP)</abbr></dfn>
                - when the largest image (or video frane) or piece of text
                visible from the initial viewport loads
              </li>
              <li>
                <dfn>Speed index</dfn> - sum of the percent of screen that is
                visually loaded across 100 ms intervals until initial viewport
                is fully loaded.
              </li>
              <li>
                <dfn>Time to Interactive</dfn> - when the last
                <dfn title="">long task</dfn> (task taking over 50 ms on the
                main thread) of initial loading completes and another long task
                would not run within 5 seconds if the user was idle.
              </li>

              <p>
                Another useful term is <dfn>above the fold content</dfn>, which
                refers to the content that is visible before any scrolling ("the
                fold" being the bottom edge of the screen).
              </p>
            </ul>
          </li>

      <h2>General strategies</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Optimize loading the critical path. Defer/delay loading scripts,
            media (compressed & optimized), and content that are below the fold,
            not interactive, or less important.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid jumping reflows. Always provide placecholders for slower
            loading content to avoid the increased perception of loading and
            difficulty of usability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make fallback fonts and their sizes and weights consistent to avoid
            text flickering once the final font loads in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep interactive elements feeling snappy. Users perceive lag most
            noticeably during interaction, so keep the user unblocked and
            receiving feedback (like using type-ahead patterns and rendering
            quickly any changes associated with updating an input or pressing a
            buttton).
            <ul>
              Examples:
              <li>
                Performing operations on <code>keydown</code> instead of
                <code>keyup</code>.
              </li>
              <li>Showing loading animations as early as possible.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Performance Tools</h2>

      <h2>Image Performance</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          <code>loading="lazy"</code> on images and video (and iframes) defers
          loading to when the element is a certain distance of being visible in
          the viewport. This attribute will simply be ignored if not supported.
        </p>
        <h3>Optimal formats</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>SVG for non-photos: icons, charts, logos, etc.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>(Warning: very new)</strong>AVIF for photos / raster images
            (lossless or lossy) and animations
          </li>
          <li>
            WebP for photos / raster images (lossless or lossy) and animations
          </li>
          <li>
            PNG as fallback for WebP (PNG8 if PNG24 is much larger than WebP)
            <p style="display: block">
              - Progressive JPEGs as fallback if size is a big concern (even a
              browser that doesn't support it will render the full res image
              once the entire file is downloaded)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><em>NEVER</em></strong> use GIF for non-animations (and
            prefer video/WebP/AVIF even then)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Certain CDNs will serve the ideal format for you automatically.</p>

        <h3>Compression</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Higher DPI equates to a higher resolution image in the same screen
            space, so compression can be higher than usual on these images.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not create assets past 2x DPI since very few people can notice a
            difference beyond 2x.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Optimal Sizes</h3>
        <p>
          Use <code>srcset</code> attribute with <code>img</code> or
          <code>source</code> to provide different images for different viewport
          sizes and DPRs.
        </p>

        <h3>Image Priority</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Background images should be defined in CSS since those get lower
            download than HTML image elements priority.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>fetchpriority="high/low/auto"</code> allows for
            de/prioritizing certain iamge downloads.
            <small style="display: block"
              >NOTE: quite new, so don't rely on.</small
            >
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Readability when Using Background Images</h3>
        <p>
          If text would not be visible without a background image being
          displayed, make sure an initial background color is set to ensure
          readability before the image download completes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>Video Performance</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Compression and Format</h3>
        <p>Always compress videos and provide multiple formats.</p>

        <h3>Source order</h3>
        <p>
          Since the browser downloads the file for the first
          <code>&lt;source type="video/xxx"&gt;</code> it supports, ALWAYS put
          the <code>source</code> element with the smallest file first within
          the <code>video</code> element, unless you have a particular reason to
          show especially high quality when browser-supported.
        </p>

        <h3>Preferred formats (containers)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>WebM: Open format but much newer (so provide fallback)</li>
          <li>MP4: Most compatible by far</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Preferred Codecs</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            VP9: Open format, roughly comparable to HEVC
            <small style="display: block"
              >(Note: VP8 mainly used with just WebP (VP8 frame underlies its
              data format), so always prefer VP9 for video and usually with the
              WebM container).</small
            >
          </li>
          <li>H.264/AVC: most common - the standard</li>
          <li>
            H.265/HEVC: better compression than H.264 but requires up-to-date
            broswers and more recent hardware decoders (so keep an eye on
            support for the future)
          </li>
          <li>
            AV1: best compression for quality, but it does not work in many
            browsers (so keep an eye on support in the future).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Autoplay</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to the <code>autoplay</code> and
          <code>loop</code> attributes, the following attributes should always
          be added to autoplay video without user-triggering:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>muted</code> - required for some mobile browsers (Safari)
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>playsinline</code> - required by Safari to allow autoplay and
            prevent videos from attempting to trigger a fullscreen flow
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note: only autoplay videos when necessary since it adds download size
          and can be annoying to users, depending on context.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >Always remove audio from hero videos (and other videos that are not
            intended to have sound).</strong
          >
        </p>

        <h3>Preload</h3>
        <p>
          The default value for <code>preload</code> is not consistent, so
          prefer being explicit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Setting <code>preload</code> to <code>"none"</code> is usually best to
          minimized download size, but if you <em>strongly expect</em> the video
          to be played and do not have a streamable source, use
          <code>"metadata"</code> to improve playback start while keeping
          initial download size minimal (2-5% of the size of the actual video
          file).
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>autoplay</code> attribute will override
          <code>preload</code>, so rarely leave <code>preload</code> undefined
          (equivalent to <code>preload="auto"</code>) since the browser is
          allowed to download the entire video in advance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to populate a thumbnail when setting
          <code>preload="none"</code>, the <code>poster</code> attribute can be
          used.
          <small
            >(Note: <code>preload="metadata"</code> will often provide the
            thumbnail, but test to be sure.)</small
          >

      <h2>JS Performance</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          <strong>Profile your site's performance.</strong> Not all of these
          strategies are needed all of the time, so do not assume causes of

        </p>

        <h3>Minimize JS Used</h3>
        <ol>
          4 steps I'm calling
          <strong
            ><dfn>SM<sup>2</sup></dfn></strong
          >:
          <li>
            <strong>Simplify</strong>
            <p>
              Don't use a framework (which are JS-heavy) for very simple pages /
              use cases, when it would not add undue complication.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep things simple, unless improvements are 1) needed/appreciated
              on the dev-side or 2) appreciated on the user-side.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use built-in functionality when possible instead of adding complex
              libraries or your own code.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Modularize</strong>
            <p>Separate JS files into critical and non-critical files.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Strip</strong>
            <p>
              Remove unused code. If it isn't being used (whether it's your code
              or from a framework), it shouldn't be getting downloaded.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Minify (+ Compress)</strong>
            <p>Reduce characters of your files to reduce download size.</p>
            <p>
              Compress files (via Gzip, Brotli, etc.) to further reduce bytes
              downloaded.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Much of steps 2 through 4 should be handled by a bundler (like
          Webpack).
        </p>

        <h3>When to Load JS</h3>
        <p>
          JS files, by default, are parser-blocking in that they must be
          downloaded, parsed, and run, before HTML parsing can continue.
          <small style="display: block"
            >NOTE: they are not <em>download-blocking</em>, so other previously
            seen linked resources can still be downloaded in parallel.</small
          >
        </p>

        <h4>- Preload Critical Scripts</h4>
        <p class="code-background">
          <code> &lt;script src="main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code> is
          parser-blocking.
        </p>
        <p class="code-background">
          <code
            >&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; href=&quot;important-js.js&quot;
            as=&quot;script&quot; /&gt;</code
          >
          AND
          <code
            >&lt;link rel=&quot;modulepreload&quot;
            href=&quot;important-module.js&quot; /&gt;</code
          >
          are not.
        </p>
        <p>
          The file may still be downloading by the time it is referenced (via
          <code>script</code> element or <code>import</code> call, for a
          module), at which point the download becomes parser-blocking, but the
          <em>duration</em> of that block will be reduced.
        </p>

        <h4>- Defer Non-critical Scripts</h4>
        <p>
          There are a few ways to defer script execution until after the HTML
          has been parsed, flowed, and painted
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>script async</code> - these scripts download in parallel,
            execute in any order (do not obey script order in the document), and
            will <strong>block</strong> parser rendering when they execute upon
            download finish, if the HTML is still being parsed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>script defer</code> - these scripts download in parallel, BUT
            preserve execution order in the document AND do not run until the
            HTML has painted once (note: module scripte are deferred by
            default). <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> does not fire until after
            all deferred scripts complete.
          </li>
          <li class="code-background">
            <p>
              Alternatively, if you do not want specific JS code to execute
              until a certain trigger point in the code, you can load it via JS
              like this:
            </p>
            <code style="display: block; white-space: pre; margin-top: 0.5rem"
              >const scriptElem = document.createElement("script");
              scriptElem.src = "index.js"; scriptElem.addEventListener("load",
              () => { // Run a function contained within index.js once it has
              definitely loaded init(); });
              document.head.append(scriptElem);</code
            >
            <p>Or like this:</p>
            <code style="display: block; white-space: pre; margin-top: 0.5rem"
              >import("./modules/myModule.js").then((module) => { // Do
              something with the module });</code
            >
            <p>
              NOTE: Only load JS dependencies like this when necessary (such as
              if the import must be constructed at runtime due to environment or
              something, there is an unavoidable performance penalty to loading,
              etc.) since it can be hard to tree shake dead code for non-static
              dependencies.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          NOTE: <code>load</code> event fires after all dependencies derived
          from the HTML+CSS+JS parse tree have downloaded (images, scripts,
          etc.).
        </p>

        <h3>Break up Long Tasks</h3>
        <p>
          Promise-based APIS post to the microtask queue while non-Promise-based
          APIs post to the event queue (such as
          <code>setTimeout(fun(), 0)</code>). We can utilize this to break up
          heavy tasks into pieces that allow for other events to be handled in
          between.
        </p>
        <p class="code-background">
          Example:
          <code style="display: block; white-space: pre"
            >async function longTask() { const tasks = [a, b, c, d, e]; while
            (tasks.length > 0) { const task = tasks.shift(); task(); await new
            Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 0)); } }</code
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, use <strong>web workers</strong> for large computations
          that don't involve much DOM maniupulation (since they cannot access
          the DOM).
        </p>

        <h3>JS Animations</h3>
        <p>
          Use CSS animations or the Web Animations API (which hooks into CSS
          animations) <em>whenever</em> possible.
        </p>
        <p class="code-background">
          If you <em>have</em> to use JS directly for an animation, use
          <code>Window.requestAnimationFrame()</code>, usually with a
          <code>canvas</code> element, like so:
          <code style="display: block; white-space: pre"
            >function loop(timestamp) { // Draw some stuff then re-queue for the
            next frame // Note: always compute the offset from last loop call to
            avoid animation running faster on high-refresh displays
            requestAnimationFrame(loop); } requestAnimationFrame(loop)</code
          >
        </p>

        <h3>Event Listening Performance</h3>
        <p>Tracking lots of events can be taxing on performance.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remove no longer needed listeners.</li>
          <li>
            Set listeners on parent elements instead if many child elements will
            all have the same (or similar click listeners) since you can always
            determine the target of a click via the event
            <code>target</code> property.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>DOM Manipulation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Reduce changes to the DOM because they are computationally
              expensive.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(Note: Performance benefit debatable)</strong> If you have
              performance issues when a making a lot of DOM changes at once (a
              loop or something), test using <code>DocumentFragment</code> to
              construct the entire tree before updating.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>HTML Performance</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          <strong>Profile your site's performance.</strong> Not all of these
          strategies are needed all of the time, so do not assume causes of
          performance issues before <em>measuring</em> network and performance.
        </p>

        <h3><code>iframes</code></h3>
        <p>
          <code>iframes</code> are more expensive than hosting code natively in
          the page, so use them wisely.
        </p>
        <p>
          They also must download all resources independently
          <em>unless</em> they host content from the same origin and have the
          <code>allow-same-origin</code> sandbox permission.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Lazy load 3rd-party iframes whenever possible.</strong></p>

        <p>
          (You can manually provide data to construct an iframe (via
          <code>src</code> or <code>srcdoc</code>), but this is not a general
          use case unless your 1st-party iframe usage is heavy.)
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>CSS Performance</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          <strong>Profile your site's performance.</strong> Not all of these
          strategies are needed all of the time, so do not assume causes of
          performance issues before <em>measuring</em> network and performance.
        </p>

        <h3>The CSSOM</h3>
        <p>
          The CSSOM and the DOM constructions are <em>not</em> tightly coupled.
          Thus, they are not blocked on each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>However</em>, CSSOM construction is render-blocking, so all
          stylesheets that match media queries for the page <em>must</em> be
          loaded before the initial render.
        </p>

        <p>
          NOTE: <code>link</code> elements for stylesheets are only
          render-blocking, not <em>parser-blocking</em> like scripts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Deferred scripts (and thus <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>) are
          <em>meant to</em> (according to the spec) wait until all
          render-blocking CSS has been loaded (similar to blocking scripts), but
          this behavior is not true in all browsers yet. Therefore, if a script
          must rely on critical CSS to be loaded, preload the script and then
          call it as a standard blocking script at the end of the document.
        </p>

        <h3>Optimizing CSS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tree shake dead CSS (or have some other organizational method).
          </li>
          <li>
            Split CSS into files according to media query and non-/critical
            path. They will still be downloaded, but they won't be treated as
            render-blocking.
          </li>
          <li>Minify and compress.</li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong
                >(NOTE: Low performance gains for these except in very complex /
                styled cases.)</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>Keep selectors simple until they need to be complex.</p>
            <p>
              Also CSS selectors are evaluated right to left, so a more specific
              selector at the end of a selector list will be more performant.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use SVG/CSS sprites or icon fonts to reduce icon HTTP requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preload font faces (or <code>preconnect</code>) and critical images
            from CSS files to avoid waiting until the line is parsed in a
            particular CSS file to start the download.
            <small style="display: block"
              >Interesting note: fonts are loaded once used instead of when
              declared via <code>@font-face</code>, which is even more reason to
              preload them.</small
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            For font formates, use <code>.woff2</code> with
            <code>.woff</code> as a fallback since these can be compressed
            (other types cannot).
            <small style="display: block"
              >NOTE: make sure to include <code>format</code> property since
              font types are only determined after download completes.</small
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            For different fonts for different languages w/ different characters,
            use <code>unicode-range</code> in
            <code>@font-face</code> declarations so that the font will only be
            downloaded and used if a particular language's characters are
            detected.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CSS Animations</h3>
        <p>
          Prefer using <code>transform</code> or animating only
          <code>opacity</code> or <code>filter</code> since these do not trigger
          reflows. Note that <code>transform</code> <em>never</em> affects the
          document flow, so other elements will not reposition accordingly.
        </p>
        <small
          >Note: Only use <code>will-change</code> property as a last result to
          improve animation performance (i.e., only when performance is already
          bad, not preemptively).</small
        >

        <h3>Font Styling</h3>
        <p>Text loading has 2 main periods:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>block</strong> - text is rendered with an
            <em>invisible</em> fallback font.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>swap</strong> - text is rendered with a
            <em>visible</em> fallback font
          </li>
        </ol>
        <small style="display: block"
          >Technically, there can also be a failure period, but that always
          kicks off a fallback font usage.</small
        >
        <p>
          <code>font-display</code> controls these periods and can provide a
          better text loading UX:
        </p>

        <p>
          The default behavior (usually) is synonymous and then swap to the font
          once downloaded (known as a <dfn>FOIT</dfn>, Flash of Invisible Text).
          If a few seconds elapse,
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>font-display</code> can tweak this for a snappier experience:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>block</code> (few sec block, infinite swap time) - synonymous
            (usually) with default behavior usually but good to be explicit if
            this behavior is desired (causes <dfn>FOIT</dfn>, Flash of Invisible
            Text).
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>swap</code> (very short block, infinite swap time) - causes
            <dfn>FOUT</dfn>, Flash of Unstyled Text
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>fallback</code> (very short block, few sec swap) - causes
            FOUT, but prevents text swap at much later point
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>optional</code> (very short block, no swap) - should only be
            used if custom font is considered not important to UX
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Prioritizing Performance</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Performance Budgets</h3>
        <p>
          Define important limits for your site/page/assets/images/whatever,
          such as max HTTP requests, max total size, max loading time for a
          specific user agent or device.
        </p>
        <p>
          This provides you breakpoints to know when performance is becoming an
          issue.
        </p>

        <h3>KPIs</h3>
        <ul>
          Some important KPIs to monitor:
          <li>Converstion rate / funnels for certain actions/flows</li>
          <li>
            Average time on site (to determine if users are abandoning due to
            performance, rather than a specific flow)
          </li>
          <li>
            Net Promotion Score <dfn>(NPS)</dfn>, which assesses user brand
            loyalty (likelihood to recommend)
          </li>
        </ul>
