      <h2>Stages of Planning</h2>
      <section>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Initial Planning (determine important constraints)
            <ul>
              <li>
                expected user base (should the page be flashy? just functional? what are
                expectations?)
              </li>
              <li>
                expected device/network capability (do we need to be planning around low network as
                a primary use-case?)
              </li>
              <li>
                browser support range needed (how many versions back on popular browsers? IE11???
                ðŸ˜±)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Development
            <ul>
              <li>Focus on functionality first.</li>
              <li>
                Accept some things won't work exactly the same between browsers (and communicate
                these differences and the cost/time of bringing them more in line with each other to
                stakeholders).
              </li>
              <li>
                Do not do ALL tests on non-production assets. Make sure that validation of important
                functionality will be done on the distributable actually being served to users.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Testing
            <ul>
              <li>
                During development:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Test in your usual development browser.
                    <p style="font-size: 0.9em">
                      NOTE: Often a preview version is helpful to see if new bug fixes / features
                      are coming out. <br /><br />
                      An alternative strategy is to always use the browser with the most issues
                      first, which is generally Safari now that IE is deprecated.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Mobile-format first</li>
                      <li>Desktop after</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Test in other common browsers.</li>
                  <li>Test on physical mobile device (Android & iOS if you can).</li>
                  <li>Test accessibility (keyboard only, screen reader, etc.).</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                After development:
                <ul>
                  <li>Perform automated E2E tests.</li>
                  <li>
                    If needed, pay for a service (like BrowserStack) to perform some of the above
                    (on real/simulated devices).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixes
            <ol>
              <li>
                Try to repro the bug in a few browsers/versions to see if the bug is a browser
                issue. If so, determine if the bug is fixed in the most recent version, and if it
                isn't, file a bug report with with the pertinent browser.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the bug is a browser issue, develop a workaround. If it is not, fix your own code
                as necessary for priority and debugging/time cost.
                <p>
                  NOTE: sometimes specific browsers require specific fixes that can be triggered via
                  user agent detection.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Browser Support</h2>
      <section>
        <p>Generally, support should be split into 3 tiers:</p>
        <ol style="list-style: upper-alpha">
          <li>Modern browsers - receive the full experience</li>
          <li>Older/limited browsers - simplified, but still as good expereince as possible</li>
          <li>
            Old browsers - don't test, but provide general enough fallbacks that site is still
            usable
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Determining Support</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Define expected regions and user profiles of importance</li>
          <li>
            Get statistics about those expected regions / user profiles (such as via
            <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/">Statcounter</a>)
          </li>
          <li>
            Set up your own analytics once the site is launched (such as via
            <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>),
            or retrieve analytics from another site your company already has.
            <p>
              NOTE: Test your browser on any browsers that you would expect more users for because
              they might not be using the site if the site is broken for them.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Testing Lab</h3>
        <p>Rcommended general browsers to test:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Chrome</li>
          <li>Safari (Apple Only)</li>
          <li>Firefox</li>
          <li>Edge (Windows Only)</li>
          <li>Opera</li>
          <li>Samsung browser (mobile only)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Emulation via browser tools (or heavier tools) is usually enough for development, but a
          final pass and/or suite of tests should be run on-device if possible.
        </p>

        <p>Recommended physical devices for testing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Desktop - Mac & Windows</li>
          <li>Mobile - iPhone & Android</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          VMs can be useful for testing multiple OSes when you don't have the physical devices and
          emulators are not an option, such as testing Edge on Windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Note: Edge does not allow for multiple version installations, so you would need multiple
          VMs to test multiple versions.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Use a blank profile or a private browsing session when doing in-person testing to avoid extensions,
          cookies, or caching from influencing testing.
