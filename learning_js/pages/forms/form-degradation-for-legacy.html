  <form>
    <ul>
      <li>Unrecognized <code>type</code> values for <code>input</code> elements degrade to the <code>text</code> type
      </li>
      <li>Generally use as little CSS styling as possible for form fields since they are so difficult and inconsistent
        to style.</li>
      <li>Follow unobtrusive JS principles where the site should still function as much as possible if a script breaks.
      </li>
      <li>Polyfills can be slow on legacy browsers, so be wary of using too many or ones that are too heavy.</li>
      <li>Use <code>@supports</code> for feature queries.</li>
    </ul>
  </form>
