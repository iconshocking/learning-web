    <h1>Tooling</h1>
    <h2>Development (Safety Net & Convenience)</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Linters</h3>
      <p>Detect possible bugs and issues in your code.</p>
      <p>- <strong>ESLint</strong> is the defacto JS linter.</p>
      <p>
        - <strong>Stylelint</strong> is the most common CSS linter (can be extended to support SCSS,
        CSS-in-JS, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>- <strong>webhint</strong> to address common issues in general web-facing code.</p>

      <h3>Formatters</h3>
      <p>Format code according to generally agreed-upon ruleset.</p>
      <p>
        - <strong>Prettier</strong> is common for web-facing files. Anything is good and stick to
        the default unless you have a very good reason not to in order to avoid bikeshedding.
      </p>

      <h3>Bundlers</h3>
      <p>
        Package code/assets for deployment, tree shake so that only necessary code is bundled, can
        (usually) run local dev server with live reloads.
      </p>
      <p>
        - For most projects: <strong>Vite</strong> is focused on developer speed and runs different
        internal bundlers depending on the environment:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Rollup</strong> for production (uses esbuild for transpiling and minification
          since Rollup is not a transpiler)
        </li>
        <li>
          <p></p>
          <strong>esbuild</strong> for development (which uses native ES modules for hot reloading
          via module replacement)
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Hot reloading</strong> is when only the files changed are automatically
              reloaded, preserving the state of the app
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Live reloading</strong> is when the app is restarted automatically when files
              are changes, so app state is lost
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        for prod (<strong>Rollup</strong>) vs dev (<strong>esbuild</strong>, which uses native ES
        modules - can also use <strong>SWC</strong> if enabled). This means it is very fast, but the
        code is different between dev and prod, which can be sometimes be a problem for testing
        complex applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        - For very large, complex applications: <strong>Webpack</strong> has the largest ecosystem
        and most flexibility but it can be quite a burden to use and is losing favorability.
        <br />
        (Does not contain a transpiler by default, but <strong>Babel</strong> is common.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: bundlers will <strong><dfn>cache bust</dfn></strong> the files for distribution, which
        means that the output files will have different names each time to prevent browsers from
        caching an outdate version of the page.
      </p>

      <div style="padding-left: 1rem">
        <h4>- Minifiers</h4>
        <p>Bundlers ususally incorporate default minifiers, but they can usually be swapped.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>SWC</strong> or <strong>esbuild</strong> are the fastest and generally more
          desirable than <strong>terser</strong>, <strong>Uglify</strong>, or
          <strong>Babel</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Random Useful Librarires</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lodash</strong> - JS convenience functions BUT a lot of these can be achieved
          effectively natively
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RxJS</strong> - when a reactive library is needed (some frameworks/librarie, like
          React,already have their own reactive patterns, so do not layer RxJS on top)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Redux (maybe w/ Redux Toolkit)</strong> - for complex application state management
        </li>
        <li><strong>Immer</strong> - convenience for immutable state management/updates</li>
        <li><strong>Day.js</strong> - date/timestamp management</li>
        <li><strong>Zod</strong> - schema validation and runtime type checking</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chart.js (D3 if lots of customization required)</strong> - for rendering charts
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Express</strong> - Node backend (recommend looking into
          <strong>Fastify</strong> though)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mapbox GL (or Maplibre GL for OSS)</strong> - Displaying maps</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Axios</strong> - making HTTP requests (not really necessary anymore unless you
          can't use Node 18+, which supports <code>fetch</code> API, or you just want to not
          write/find your own wrappers)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tailwind / CSSModules</strong> - CSS organizational libraries (some prefer to just
          use vanilla CSS or CC-in-JS)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Transformation (??? -> JS/CSS/HTML)</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Transpilers</h3>
      <p>
        Convert either non-native JS/CSS/HTML into valid code or replaces valid code using modern
        features with code that will run on older browsers (A
        <dfn>polyfill</dfn> is generated that turns modern JS/CSS into code that effectively
        reproduces the behavior - note sometimes this may not performant).
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          For JS:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>SWC</strong> is very fast (built in Rust), but less mature and so has less
              plugins available.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>esbuild</strong> is a transpiler as well as bundler and is the transpiler in
              Vite.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Babel</strong> if you need particular configurations and compatibility.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          For CSS: <strong>PostCSS</strong> (generates JS polyfill if older CSS cannot reproduce
          behavior)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Extension Languages</h3>
      <p>
        Allow for writing code that is not native JS/CSS/HTML but that can be transpiled into valid
        syntax that can be run in the browser.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For CSS: <strong>SCSS</strong> allows for more code-like operations (functions,
          substitutions (called mixins), etc.) and convenient syntax that are not currently
          supported (or at least widely supported) in CSS.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For JS:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Typescript</strong> is a superset of JS in that all JS is valid TS, but TS
                provides type-checking during development but <em>not in the browser</em>. TS types
                are only for development and have no resulting effect on the output JS.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note: <strong>tsc</strong> is the default TS transpiler, but it is slow. It should
                generally only be used for type-checking and allow general purpose transpilers to do
                that work.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>JSX</strong> used to write React components</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For HTML:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Svelte</strong>, which is written similarly to HTML, but inserts JS into it
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Templates</strong> are used in backend frameworks like
              <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Angular</strong> to generate dynamic HTML
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Frameworks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For new projects that can afford some growing pains:
          <strong>Svelte</strong> (possibly with <strong>SvelteKit</strong>) ships smaller bundles,
          better performance in browser, and good DX.
        </li>
        <li>
          For standard projects: <strong>React</strong> (possibly with <strong>Next.js</strong>) has
          the largest ecosystem and most developers have some knowledge of it.
        </li>
        <li>
          For very large projects or legacy projects:
          <strong>Angular</strong> is an opinonated framework with a lot of built-in tooling that
          allows for consistency across projects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Non-Client-Side Frameworks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><dfn title="Content Management System">CMS</dfn></strong
          >: good when content is simple, will be created mainly by non-programmers, and/or can fit
          into certain templates with limited flexibility (sometimes referred to as
          <dfn>WYSIWYG</dfn>, "what you see is what you get").
          <p>
            - There is a variant called <strong>Headless CMS</strong>, which is for content storage,
            but replaces the presentation layer with an API that allows a different framework to
            composit the page itself (require more programming language than monolithic CMS).
          </p>
          <p>Best options are dependent on non-technical users' requirements.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><dfn title="Server-Side Rendering">SSR</dfn></strong>
          frameworks: optimizes the initial loading of the page (since content fetched is closer to
          the source, which avoids DNS hops, and it avoids the initial round trip of downloading a
          stub HTML file) and best supports SEO (since links are not easy to crawl via CSR apps
          rendered entirely via an initial JS).
          <p>
            Common options are <strong>Next.js</strong> or <strong>Remix</strong> for React and
            <strong>SvelteKit</strong> for Svelte.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><dfn title="Static Site Generators">SSG</dfn></strong
          >: via serving HTML that is generated at build time, it is good for content that is always
          the same for all users and/or doesn't change often.
          <p>Common options are <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Astro</strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><dfn title="Content Deliver Networks">CDN</dfn></strong
          >: cache assets on distributed servers to serve to users as fast as possible.
          <p>
            Common options are <strong>Cloudflare</strong> and <strong>Cloudfront</strong> and some
            larger S/IAAS products include this.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Post-Development (Testing/Deployment)</h2>
    <section>
      <p>This part of development should ideally be as automated as possible.</p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          General scanning tools for web page issues:
          <strong>Lighthouse, webhint, aXe</strong> (for accessibility). These should be integrated
          with CI/CD in some way usually.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unit testing: <strong>Vitest</strong> works out-of-the-box with Vite and supports
          <dfn>ESM</dfn>, ECMAScript Modules.
          <small
            >NOTE: Some awareness of <strong>Jest</strong> is good since it is more popular.</small
          >
        </li>
        <li>E2E testing: <strong>Playwright</strong> is relatively new but language agnostic.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Most important kinds of testing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unit</strong> testing - components in isolation</li>
        <li><strong>Integration</strong> testing - components integrating with each other</li>
        <li><strong>E2E</strong> testing - simulates a flow that a user would experience</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: <strong>Regression testing</strong> is not a particular stlye of test as much as a
        test suite that should be run to ensure existing features remain workign correctly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: there is a difference between <strong>test runners</strong> (Jest, Vitetest, etc.),
        which find/run/evaluate the tests, and <strong>testing libraries</strong> (React/Svelte
        Testing Library, etc.) that provide APIs for more easily creating tests for that particular
        library/framework.
      </p>

      <h3>CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Delivery/Deployment)</h3>
      <p>
        For CI: <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> or (<strong>GitLab CI</strong>
        if hosting on GitLab) is the closest to the repos and so easiest to integrate with git
        commits/merges.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Note: <strong>Husky</strong> is useful for a local pre-CI stage, for linters, tests, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        For CD (also possibly for CI):
        <strong>whatever SAAS controls your deploys (Vercel/Azure/AWS/etc.)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: Include package manager dependency audit command in CI/CD to catch vulnerabilities
        early.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Heirarchy of How Tools Combine</h2>
    <section>
      <p style="margin: 0">
        <!-- prettier-ignore --><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
- Libraries (the definition of all the tools/dependencies in package.json)
- Bundlers (configures most other non-CI/CD tooling)
  - Transpilers (via loaders/plugins)
    - Frameworks (via plugins that are compatabile with a related transpiler)
  - Minifiers (often included in bundlers, but can be swapped out)
- CI/CD (defined via hooks or config files)
  - Linters/Formatters
  - Testing
