    <h1>Tooling</h1>
    <h2>Development (Safety Net & Convenience)</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Linters</h3>
      <p>Detect possible bugs and issues in your code.</p>
      <p>- <strong>ESLint</strong> is the defacto JS linter.</p>
      <p>
        - <strong>Stylelint</strong> is the most common CSS linter (can be extended to support SCSS,
        CSS-in-JS, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>- <strong>webhint</strong> to address common issues in general web-facing code.</p>

      <h3>Formatters</h3>
      <p>Format code according to generally agreed-upon ruleset.</p>
      <p>
        - <strong>Prettier</strong> is common for web-facing files. Anything is good and stick to
        the default unless you have a very good reason not to in order to avoid bikeshedding.
      </p>

      <h3>Bundlers</h3>
      <p>
        Package code/assets for deployment, tree shake so that only necessary code is bundled, can
        run local dev server with live reloads.
      </p>
      <p>
        - For most projects: <strong>Vite</strong> is focused on developer speed and runs two
        different internal bundlers for prod vs dev. This means it is very fast, but the bundle
        created is different between dev and prod, which can be a problem for testing complex
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        - For very large, complex applications: <strong>Webpack</strong> has the largest ecosystem
        and most flexibility but it can be quite a burden to use and is losing favorability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: bundlers will <strong><dfn>cache bust</dfn></strong> the files for distribution, which
        means that the output files will have different names each time to prevent browsers from
        caching an outdate version of the page.
      </p>

      <h3>Random Useful Librarires</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lodash</strong> - JS convenience functions BUT a lot of these can be achieved
          effectively natively
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RxJS</strong> - when a reactive library is needed (some frameworks/librarie, like
          React,already have their own reactive patterns, so do not layer RxJS on top)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Redux (maybe w/ Redux Toolkit)</strong> - for complex application state management
        </li>
        <li><strong>Immer</strong> - convenience for immutable state management/updates</li>
        <li><strong>Day.js</strong> - date/timestamp management</li>
        <li><strong>Zod</strong> - schema validation and runtime type checking</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chart.js (D3 if lots of customization required)</strong> - for rendering charts
        </li>
        <li><strong>Express</strong> - Node backend routing</li>
        <li><strong>Mapbox GL (or Maplibre GL for OSS)</strong> - Displaying maps</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Axios</strong> - making HTTP requests (not really necessary anymore unless you
          can't use Node 18+, which supports <code>fetch</code> API, or you just want to not
          write/find your own wrappers)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tailwind / CSSModules</strong> - CSS organizational libraries (some prefer to just
          use vanilla CSS or CC-in-JS)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Transformation (??? -> JS/CSS/HTML)</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Backporting Language Features</h3>
      <p>
        Allow for using up-to-date JS/CSS features but for all browsers. A <dfn>polyfill</dfn> is
        generated that turns modern JS/CSS into code that effectively reproduces the behavior (note:
        sometimes this may not performant).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>For JS: <strong>Babel</strong></li>
        <li>
          For CSS: <strong>PostCSS</strong> (generates JS polyfill if older CSS cannot reproduce
          behavior)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Transpilers/Frameworks</h3>
      <p>
        Allow for writing code that is not native, valid JS/CSS, but that generates into valid
        syntax that can be run in the browser.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For CSS: <strong>SCSS</strong> allows for more code-like operations (functions,
          substitutions (called mixins), etc.) and convenient syntax that are not currently
          supported (or at least widely supported) in CSS.
        </li>
        <li>
          For JS: <strong>Typescript</strong> is a superset of JS in that all JS is valid TS, but TS
          provides type-safety during development but <em>not in the browser</em>. TS types are only
          for development and have no resulting effect on the output JS.
        </li>
        <li>
          For frameworks/libraries:
          <ul>
            <li>
              For new projects that can afford some growing pains: <strong>Svelte</strong> (possibly
              with <strong>SvelteKit</strong>) ships smaller bundles, better performance in browser,
              and good DX.
            </li>
            <li>
              For standard projects: <strong>React</strong> (possibly with <strong>Next.js</strong>)
              has the largest ecosystem and most developers have some knowledge of it.
            </li>
            <li>
              For very large projects or legacy projects: <strong>Angular</strong> is an opinonated
              framework with a lot of built-in tooling that allows for consistency across projects.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Non-Client-Side Frameworks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><dfn title="Content Management System">CMS</dfn></strong
          >: good when content is simple, will be created mainly by non-programmers, and/or can fit
          into certain templates with limited flexibility (sometimes referred to as
          <dfn>WYSIWYG</dfn>, "what you see is what you get").
          <p>
            - There is a variant called <strong>Headless CMS</strong>, which is for content storage,
            but replaces the presentation layer with an API that allows a different framework to
            composit the page itself (require more programming language than monolithic CMS).
          </p>
          <p>Best options are dependent on non-technical users' requirements.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><dfn title="Server-Side Rendering">SSR</dfn></strong> frameworks: optimizes the
          initial loading of the page (since content fetched is closer to the source, which avoids
          DNS hops, and it avoids the initial round trip of downloading a stub HTML file) and best
          supports SEO (since links are not easy to crawl via CSR apps rendered entirely via an
          initial JS).
          <p>
            Common options are <strong>Next.js</strong> or <strong>Remix</strong> for React and
            <strong>SvelteKit</strong> for Svelte.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><dfn title="Static Site Generators">SSG</dfn></strong
          >: via serving HTML that is generated at build time, it is good for content that is always
          the same for all users and/or doesn't change often.
          <p>Common options are <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Astro</strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><dfn title="Content Deliver Networks">CDN</dfn></strong
          >: cache assets on distributed servers to serve to users as fast as possible.
          <p>
            Common options are <strong>Cloudflare</strong> and <strong>Cloudfront</strong> and some
            larger S/IAAS products include this.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Post-Development (Testing/Deployment)</h2>
    <section>
      <p>This part of development should ideally be as automated as possible.</p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          General scanning tools for web page issues:
          <strong>Lighthouse & webhint extensions.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Unit testing: <strong>Vitest</strong> works out-of-the-box with Vite and supports
          <dfn>ESM</dfn>, ECMAScript Modules.
          <small
            >NOTE: Some awareness of <strong>Jest</strong> is good since it is more popular.</small
          >
        </li>
        <li>E2E testing: <strong>Playwright</strong> is relatively new but language agnostic.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Most important kinds of testing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unit</strong> testing - components in isolation</li>
        <li><strong>Integration</strong> testing - components integrating with each other</li>
        <li><strong>E2E</strong> testing - simulates a flow that a user would experience</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: <strong>Regression testing</strong> is not a particular stlye of test as much as a
        test suite that should be run to ensure existing features remain workign correctly.
      </p>

      <h3>CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Delivery/Deployment)</h3>
      <p>
        For CI: <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> or (<strong>GitLab CI</strong> if hosting on GitLab)
        is the closest to the repos and so easiest to integrate with git commits/merges.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Note: <strong>Husky</strong> is useful for a local pre-CI stage, for linters, tests, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        For CD (also possibly for CI):
        <strong>whatever SAAS controls your deploys (Vercel/Azure/AWS/etc.)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: Include package manager dependency audit command in CI/CD to catch vulnerabilities
        early.
