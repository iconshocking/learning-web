    Therefore, decide if FOIT or FOUT is more desirable for a user's first experience to your site
    for fonts (via 'font-display' attribute in @font-face). The default depends on browser but
    almost always is FOIT. -->

  <body>
    <p>Stylesheets (`link` elements) behavior depends on the location:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the <code>head</code>, <em>render-blocking</em>.</li>
      <li>
        In the <code>body</code>, <em>possible</em> render-blocking and parser-blocking. Different
        browsers may render the rest of the HTML while downloading the stylesheet or just render the
        HTML up to the stylesheet. Either way, this behavior is inconsistent, so don't rely on it if
        possible.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- this will block until purple.css finishes downloading, the prior HTML + CSS will be loaded,
    then the script will be executed -->
    <script src="hello-goodbye.js"></script>
    <!-- parsing will block here until this script loads -->
    <script src="domcontentloaded.js"></script>
    <!-- this stylesheet will maybe render-block depending on the browser, but some will render the
    rest of the HTML while downloading -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="green.css" />
    <p>Script behavior depends on its type:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>async</code>: not parser-blocking (until downloaded) or render-blocking. Note: module
        scripts will also download dependencies in parallel. <strong>WARNING:</strong>
        <code>async</code> scripts do not wait for CSS to load.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>defer</code>: not parser-blocking and runs only after HTML parsed and
        <strong>ALL</strong> CSS finished loading. <strong>NOTE:</strong> if all the CSS finished
        loading before the HTML finished parsing (such as when pulled from cache), the script will
        run <em>AFTER</em> first paint.
      </li>
      <li>
        normal script: parser-blocking and waits for all earlier CSS in the HTML to finish loading.
        This means that normal scripts can be placed in the body to force HTML elements with
        <em>at least</em> any prior styling to render by a certain point (cached CSS or fast ).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <code>DOMContenLoaded</code> event fires after HTML has been fully parsed and deferred scripts
      have run (and normal scripts since those are parser-blocking). It will <em>not</em> wait for
      stylesheets to load UNLESS there is a non-async script (deferred or normal) because those
      scripts block until prior CSS has loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>DOMContenLoaded</code> has nothing to do with <em>rendering</em>, besides guaranteeing
      that all the HTML elements will have been parsed prior to firing. One slow-loading deferred
      script, will prevent the event from firing until long after the page is visible and all CSS is
      loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>load</code> event is what fires when all dependent resources referenced in the HTML
      have loaded: stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and images (not video because that is usally
      streamed as it plays), <em>except</em> images/iframes that are lazy-loaded.
