      <h1>Reverse Proxy and Nginx</h1>
      <h2>What are proxies?</h2>
      <section>
        <p>Proxies are opaque gateways to participants in a connection:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Forward proxy:</strong> intercepts client-side and makes clients unkown to
            server. Use cases:
            <ul>
              <li>User privacy</li>
              <li>
                Security / data policies since traffic can be inspected before leaving the network
              </li>
              <li>Traffic monitoring</li>
              <li>Shadow IT detection (detecting non-IT-approved devices)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reverse proxy:</strong> intercepts server-side and makes servers unkown to
            client. Use cases:
            <ul>
              <li>Load balancing</li>
              <li>URL routing & rewriting</li>
              <li>Traffic monitoring</li>
              <li>Security by hiding backend servers structure</li>
              <li>
                TLS termination (allowing simpler use of HTTP communication between networked
                servers)
              </li>
              <li>Caching and serving static content</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Proxy Headers</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Since reverse proxies intercept requests, certain HTTP headers are used to relay the
          information about the original client request:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>X-Forwarded-For:</strong> chain of IP addresses for the request, starting with
            the original sender and followed by each additional proxy
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>X-Forwarded-Proto:</strong> original protocol of the request ('http' vs 'https'
            usually)
          </li>
          <li><strong>X-Forwarded-Port:</strong> original port of the request</li>
          <li>
            <strong>X-Forwarded-Host:</strong> original target host of the request (i.e., the URL
            the client requested)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Via:</strong> the protocol and host in each step of the proxied request chain
            (most useful for determining protocol)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because these headers are not 'forbidden' (which mean 'cannot be modified programmatically
          / by code other than the user-agent itself'), these headers cannot be trusted and so
          should always be overwritten by the proxy server with the values it knows to be true.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>Nginx</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Nginx is a very common web server often used as a reverse proxy, where 'upstream' refers
          to the servers being proxied.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are four phases of the request/response communication that are described in the
          table below:
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>from</th>
              <th>to</th>
              <th>type</th>
              <th>read header (variable)</th>
              <th>write header (directive)</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>client</td>
              <td>nginx</td>
              <td>request</td>
              <td>$http_[header_name]</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>nginx</td>
              <td>upstream</td>
              <td>request</td>
              <td></td>
              <td>proxy_set_header</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>upstream</td>
              <td>nginx</td>
              <td>response</td>
              <td>$upstream_http_[header_name]</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>nginx</td>
              <td>client</td>
              <td>response</td>
              <td>$sent_http_[header_name]</td>
              <td>add_header</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
          Nginx buffers proxied responses until the entire response returns, which allows servers to
          quickly return responses, and then slow clients don't eat up resources with long download
          times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: statics should generally be resolved under a different sub/domain so that cookies
          aren't sent in requests, eating up bandwidth (usually called a "cookie-less domain").
          However, a CDN achieves this same result, so a cookie-less domain is usually not
          necessary.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>Security w/ Compression</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Due to the BREACH vulnerability, compressed HTTPS (and HTTP, trivially) is vulnerable to
          deciphering. Therefore gzip/brotli compression should never be used when transmitting
          sensitive information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, compress text-based static content (media is already compressed), but don't
          ever compress HTML (to avoid accidentally compressing when sensitive information is
          present).
        </p>
        <p>
          NOTE: compressed <em>requests</em> are never supported to avoid vulnerabilites like
          opening a compression bomb.
