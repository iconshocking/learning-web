      <h1>Security</h1>
      <p>
        Security should always be considered as "layered". Breaking each line of defense should only
        provide limitedly more access, which is guarded by the remaining layers.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE: If there are ways to circumnavigate layers, then those layers don't functionally exist
        because one attack vector is breaking through several layers at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        The #1 security technique is to never blankly trust data from the browser (URL parameters,
        POST bodies, HTTP headers, cookies, uploaded files, etc.)
      </p>

        <!-- MARK: XSS -->
        <h2>XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)</h2>
        <p>
          XSS is the <em>MOST</em> important security vulnerability to avoid since it means the
          attacker can run arbitrary code.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Reflected:</strong> user content is returned by the server immediately and
          unmodified. <br />
          Ex: emailing the following link to a user to steal their cookies:
          <code
            >http://developer.mozilla.org?search=beer&lt;script%20src="http://example.com/tricky.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Persistent:</strong> when malicious content is stored by the site and distributed
          to users. <br />
          Ex: a commenting system that supports unmodified HTML, which thus allows users to insert
          scripts.
        </p>

        <p>Always sanitize user inputs and/or disable the markup (maybe via some container)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>from the URL</li>
          <li>from anything that allows submitting text or files that will be rendered</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Elements to scrub include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>,
          <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>.

          Malicious example:
          <code>statement = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + userName + "';"</code> when
          provided with <code>a';DROP TABLE users;</code> becomes
          <code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'a';DROP TABLE users; </code>

      <section>
        <!-- MARK: CSRF -->
        <h2>CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are always sent regardless of the referrer, so always use a token (not in cookie
          form) to verify that the request is coming from the user through means that your site
          expects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ex: Someone creates a page with a hidden script that submits a Venmo
          <code>POST</code> request to send money to their account. Since cookies are sent
          regardless of the referrer, the <code>POST</code> will be successful unless the
          <code>POST</code> requests are protected by CSRF tokens that are returned in the body of
          response, which means the user is not vulnerable only by clicking (additional ses).
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: CSRF is mostly mitigated by SameSite cookies, since with <code>"Lax"</code>, the
          cookies are sent only on navigational GET requests (though older versions of browsers,
          notably Chrome, may not adhere to that). But this protection fails to handle attacks from
          subdomains (which are "same-site") if they host user-generated content (should really be
          on a different domain altogether) or if a subdomain CNAMEs to a site out of your control
          (vendor or something). Thus, it is generally good to still have CSRF tokens for extra
          security, including against sloppy cookie setting.

        <p>
          Always set your CSP (Content Security Policy) <code>frame-ancestors</code> header to avoid
          your site being served in an iframe on malicious sites. (<code>X-Frame-Options</code> is
          the deprecated way to handle this.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This attack allows attackers to overlay their own content invisibly and intercept entered
          information or have you perform actions accidentally, such as clicking a button that
          appears to do one thing but is acutally overlaid with a 1-click order button on Amazon
          loaded in an iframe (if 1-click orders are enabled and your cookies have you signed in).

      <section>
        <h2>File Inclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Allows for loading an unintended file on the server-side, such as not santiizing when
          allowing a user to specificy a URL/path/anything to be input to code that accepts
          URLs/paths.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>

      <section>
        <!-- MARK: compression -->
        <h2>Compression attacks</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>CRIME</strong>: invalidated TLS-level compression for HTTP since the entire
          request is compressed (headers and request), so noticing compression improvements while
          guessing secrets a character at a time in the request was viable. (Ex.: putting 'secret=1'
          in the body, then 'secret=2', and so on until the compressed size was smaller, then moving
          to the next character.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>BREACH</strong>: via the same strategy as CRIME but for responses, invalidates
          HTTP-level compression when user-provided content can be reflected into the response body
          and the secret is present in both the response headers and body. (Ex.: adding
          '?name=csrf_token=1' to a form URL that then has "Hello csrf_token=1!" in the response
          body, and then continuing in the same way as CRIME.)
        </p>
        <p>Technologies that mitigate these attacks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Django: includes a random mask in the CSRF token for each response, so the token changes
            but is validatable server-side.
          </li>
          <li>
            HTTP/2 and HTTP/3: HPACK (in H2) and QPACK (in H3) header compressions do not operate
            character-by-character and such would reqiure brute force to perform the attacks.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These are examples of "oracle" attacks, where a weakness in the system can indicate how
          close an attacker is to their goal, which can provide a systematic way to complete the
          attack.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <!-- MARK: cookies -->
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies adhere to the 'same-site' policy, which is equivalent to a 'domain' policy. This
          means that port and scheme do not matter, and subdomains are also able to set cookies for
          parent sub/domains.
        </p>
        <p>There are a few important cookie security flags.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Secure</h3>
          <p>
            The <code>Secure</code> attribute means the browser will only send that cookie when
            using the https protocol, which reduces MitM attacks.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>HttpOnly</h3>
          <p>
            The <code>HttpOnly</code> attribute means that JS running in the browser has no access
            to this cookie. This should <em>always</em> be your default cookie setting unless you
            need to relax it, and it should not be relaxed for security/auth-related cookies
            (attempt other workarounds).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>SameSite</h3>
          <p>
            The <code>SameSite</code> attribute determines what the origin of the request must be
            for the browser to send cookies for that site.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>Strict</code>: browser only sends cookies when the origin of the request is of
              the same site. This is usually too strict to be useful exempt in very specific cases
              because it breaks sending cookies when using the back button (if coming from another
              site) as well as when clicking on external links to your site.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Lax</code>: browser sends cookies when origin is same-site and top-level
              navigation requests that are <em>not</em> POSTs (i.e., only GETs). This helps mitigate
              CSRF attacks, but should generally be combined with CSRF tokens.
            </li>
            <li><code>None</code>: browser always sends cookies.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <p>
          To keep cookies secure, always set them with
          <code>SameSite=Lax; Secure; HttpOnly</code> unless you have very good reason to relax
          that.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Setting cookies</h3>
          <p>
            When setting cookies, all subdomains for a site (+ the root domain) can set cookies for
            any other sub/domain.
          </p>

          <p>Domain:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>no domain:</strong> set cookie for only the domain of the resource the request
              is for
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>explicit domain:</strong> set cookie for the domain listed and all subdomains
              under it (the listed domain can be for domains heirarchically above the current
              resource of the request, but not lower or sibling)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Path:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>no path:</strong> applies to the entire subdomain computed from the domain
              attribute
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>explicit path:</strong> applies to only that path and its subdirectories
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <p>
          Note: cookies have a total size limit in that 1) cookies should not be bigger than 4 KB
          and 2) no domain should have more than 50, but err on the side of 20 (unclear if this
          includes subdomains). Browsers may starting trimming earlier cookies for a site past if
          these limits are exceeded.
        </p>

        <section>
          <!-- MARK: session fixation -->
          <h3>Session Fixation attack</h3>
          <p>
            A Session fixation attack is when a bad actor gets an anonymous (or authed) session id
            cookie, and then the bad actor passes the session to the victim. Thus, when the victim
            logs in, if the site didn't overwrite the session ID with a new session then the bad
            create a new session ID when a user auths) Session fixation is also possible with actor
            now can access the victim's account on their side by using the same session ID.
          </p>
          <p>To address, <em>always</em> create a new session ID when a user auths.</p>
          <p>
            Session fixation is also possible when subdomains set cookies on the parent domain,
            which <em>will</em> overwrite any conflicting cookies set via the parent domain. This is
            another reason to avoid user-generated content on subdomains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interseting note: '.domain' cookies (setting an explicit domain) take precedence over
            'domain' cookies (no domain was set), but they don't actually overwrite them.
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <!-- MARK: storage -->
        <h2>Session/Local Storage</h2>
        <p>
          It is <em>never</em> advised to store important secrets in client storage, so don't do it
          unless it somehow adds no security risk or the risk is not a concern.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encryption and/or clever strategies does very little to stop XSS from accessing
          local/session storage.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <!-- MARK: nav -->
        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>
          URLs support a maximum size of ~2000 characters across browsers, so make sure to stay
          under that limit to avoid issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hashes in URLs are never sent outside the browser, so servers can send redirects to
          clients that allow for storing secret data that shouldn't be sent outside the browser
          (though this isn't often used since URLs are encrypted anyway over HTTPS). See OAuth
          implicit flow for an example.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most web servers also support a max header size of ~8 KB, so make sure that cookies or
          tokens do not push up against that.
        </p>
        <p>
          In network security, <em>back-channel</em> communication (via your backend) is considered
          significantly more secure than <em>front-channel</em> (communication via the user's
          browser/application).
        </p>

        <p>HTTPS URLs are encrypted because they are in the header.</p>

          <!-- MARK: DNS -->
          <h3>DNS</h3>
          <p>
            While HTTPS URLs are encryped, the initial DNS lookup is over plaintext UDP on port 53
            (hence Amazon's Route53 naming). This reveals only the domain of the URL in the lookup
            (since extra DNS-routing will be performed at your IP address/es).
          </p>

          <section>
            <!-- MARK: secure DNS (dot / doh) -->
            <h4>DNS over TLS (DoT) / DNS over HTTPS (DoH)</h4>
            <p>To encrypt this lookup, it can be encrypted in two ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                DoT: over port 853, so easier to monitor for security since the DNS traffic is
                isolated
              </li>
              <li>
                DoH: over port 443 (HTTPS port), so more private since it is indistinguishable from
                normal HTTPS traffic but is harder to monitor
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Note: Both these protocols use TCP instead of UDP (unless using HTTP3) and must
              perform the encryption handshake (fewer roundtrips if using HTTP3), so there is
              overhead to this security.
              <em>However</em>, DNS queries are cached, so the overhead is minimized. Assess for
              your situation.

            <!-- MARK: cache-poisoning -->
            <h4>Cache-poisoning</h4>
            <p>
              A DNS query goes from your browser to a <strong>recursive resolver</strong>, which
              bounces between <strong>authoritative DNS servers</strong> to get the finalized IP
              address to return to you. First the root servers (13 globally), then the TLD
              (top-level domain) servers (like .com, etc.), then the authoritative servers for the
              domain being queried.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recursive resolvers cache the results of the DNS query for a TTL (time to live) to
              reduce the number of queries to the authoritative servers, which is where a
              cache-poisoning attack can come in, in which a malicious server returns a fake IP
              address to the recursive resolver.
            </p>

              <h5>DNSSEC</h5>
              <p>
                DNSSEC addresses cache-poisoning attacks by validating
                <em>integrity</em> and <em>authentication</em> of DNS data.
              </p>
              <p>
                DNSSEC is a form of private/public key signing of DNS records by DNS servers to
                ensure:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  that the DNS data (note: not the response itself) is not tampered with in transit
                </li>
                <li>
                  that the data came from the zone it was supposed to because you can trust the
                  public key you are provided because each higher-level zone signs (with their
                  private key) the public keys of their child zones
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Note: the root zone has no signed public key since it has no parent, but since the
                root zone signs all the TLD (top-level domains) zones' keys, an intercept at the
                root level would fail to validate the TLD keys and DNS resolution would error
