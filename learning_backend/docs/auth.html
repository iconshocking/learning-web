      <h2>Authentication/Authorization</h2>
      <p>
        'Basic authentication' ususally refers to the username and password (often concatenated with
        a colon and base64-encoded) being provided in a
        <code>Authorization: Basic [credentials]</code> header. Sometimes it can also be
        username@password such as when connecting to a database URL.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <em>"Bearer"</em> token means that the holder of this token is authorized to use it (no
        burden to prove valid possession).
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          When using sessions with a session ID token, sign the token with a secret key to prevent
          attackers from being able to arbitrarily change their session ID. HMAC (Hash-based message
          authentication code) is good for this.
        </p>

        <!-- MARK: JWT -->
        <h3>JWT (JSON Web Tokens)</h3>
        <p>JWT is a token that contains three parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>header:</strong> contains the type of token and signing algorithm</li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>payload:</strong> contains claims, which are just general information about
              the token and the user holding the token. Claims are often used for authorization by
              including roles. (Note: permissions are not recommended due to JWT size bloat which
              can get trimmed in headers or URLs)
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Registered claims are standards defined publicly and include things like
                <code>iss (issuer)</code>, <code>exp (expiration)</code>, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Custom clains, which fall into two categories:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>public</strong>, which are pertinent publically outside your application
                    (like email, name) and should be namespaced to your application to avoid
                    collision or publicly registered
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>private</strong>, which are only relevant to your application</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            signature: the signed validation of the header + payload using the server's secret key.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          JWTs can be validated by the server which can can be verified by the server using the same
          secret key. (Note: a public key can also be used, which is recommended since asymmetric
          keys reduce comprisable surface area to only the service that signs the JWTs.) This makes
          them tamper-proof externally since the signature would not be valid if the header or
          payload were changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since only the key is needed to validate JWT (stateless), it avoids session
          horizontal-scaling difficulties or having to hit an authorization server for every
          request. However, this makes JWTs very risky when compromised since they cannot be
          invalidated and instead only become invalid when they expire, which could be quite a while
          unless you log users out very frequently (bad UX).
        </p>
        <p>Refresh tokens solve this issue.</p>

        <p>
          JWTs should not contain personal information (anything remotely sensitive) about a user. A
          client should have to hit a "user info" endpoint to get any desired information about the
          user not already accessible on the client. This adds a layer of security to PII and avoids
          blatantly violating encryption at rest.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <!-- MARK: refresh tokens -->
        <h3>Refresh Tokens</h3>
        <p>
          Refresh tokens are longer-lived while authentication/authorization tokens, such as JWTS,
          are short-lived. When an auth token expires, the refresh token is used to get a new auth
          token.
        </p>
        <p>
          Refresh tokens can be invalidated, so when the short-lived auth token expires, the refresh
          token will be rejected by the server when querying for a new one, when the user logs out,
          or the user changes their login info.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Refresh token rotation</strong> enhances this security by having a new refresh
          token be returned each time you refresh the auth token. This can help detect if an old
          refresh token was stolen and to invalidate that entire refresh token chain. This is not
          foolproof though if the attacker waits and begins using the token while the victim is not
          using the site since the attacker will be able to use the refresh token apparently
          validly. It only hardens the chance of the refresh token being stolen in transit, not from
          clever XSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Web workers</strong> can be used with access tokens + refresh tokens to store the
          access token in memory and the refresh token only in the worker; thus, the browser never
          has access to the refresh token because web workers cannot be accessed by JS running in
          the main thread.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is means no persistent login though if all tabs are closed though, so this should
          only be used for very security-sensitive applications
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <!-- MARK: BFF -->
        <h3>Backend For Frontend (BFF)</h3>
        <p>
          BFFs are reverse proxies that allow for clients to have specific
          implementations/considerations unique to them that can be translated back-and-forth to a
          platform-agnostic format that the backend services can understand. This increases code
          isolation, reduces spread of code complexity, and reduces the affected surface area of
          needing to implement different auth systems (e.g., mobile apps don't have cookies, opening
          up an API to the public, etc.).
        </p>

        <p>
          Secrets or sensitive info should never end up in frontend applications that cannot be
          properly secured (or ever when possible, to reduce need to trust the client). A BFF can
          hold onto sensitive info for the client that the client cannot keep secure.
        </p>

        <p>
          BFFs need to be on the same domain as your client-specific APIs so that they can set
          cookies for them.
        </p>

        <p>
          BFFs can help prevent session riding / CSRF by inspecting for suspicious client traffic
          (steps out of order, requests coming in too fast, etc.).

      <section>
        <!-- MARK: OAuth/OPenID -->
        <h3>OAuth2 & OpenID Connect (OIDC)</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>OAuth2</strong> (1 is deprecated and very old now) is a means of
          <em>authorization</em> by which an 3rd party identity provider (IdP) can provide an access
          token to your application, such that it can perform granted actions on behalf of the user
          that authenticated with the IdP (e.g., letting a user pull their name, contacts, etc. from
          Google into your application).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>OIDC</strong> is an <em>authentication</em> extension to OAuth2 where the IdP
          provides an ID token that can be used to authenticate the user on your backend (such as
          for SSO) and also a "user info" endpoint, which can be queried with the ID token.
        </p>

        <p>Terms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>resource owner (the user)</li>
          <li>resource server (IdP's API you want access to)</li>
          <li>authorization server (IdP auth server)</li>
          <li>client (the application)</li>
          <li>
            authorization grant (type of grant you will be performing: auth code, implicit, PKCE,
            refresh token, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            redirect URI (set beforehand with IdP and is where the auth server redirects the user
            after authing with the IdP)
          </li>
          <li>
            confidential/public clients (confidential clients can use a "client secret" due to the
            code not being accessible publicly, like on a server)
          </li>
          <li>access token (for authorization)</li>
          <li>refresh token (for fetching new access token after expiration)</li>
          <li>
            <p>
              ID token (OpendIDConnect (OIDC) extension to allow for authentication on
              <em>your</em> backend)
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: ID tokens don't need to be shared with the IdP APIs, except for possibly a "user
              info" endpoint (since it is not for authorization). It also should
              <em>NEVER</em> be sent to the other 3rd parties because it can possibly be used to get
              personal information about the user.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>authorization code (exchanged for tokens)</li>
          <li>
            scopes (defined by the IdP and defines the access the user is granting your application
            to their account with the IdP)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <section>
          <!-- MARK: explicit flow -->
          <h4>OAuth explicit flow (Auth code flow)</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              User is directed to the auth server, where a prompt to provide login credentials to
              that IdP is presented, along with an explanation of what permissions this is granting
              to your application.
            </li>
            <li>
              User is redirected via predefined redirect URL for your application, containing an
              auth code query param (URL usually has limited TTL)
            </li>
            <li>
              The code is then provided to the auth server's endpoint to receive an access token and
              refresh token (and optionally an ID token)
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Client secrets are passed along with the auth code and refresh token calls. This is
            agreed upon in advance with the IdP (Identity Provider) and stored securely on the
            client. It validates a client ID and secret pair.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <!-- MARK: implicit flow -->
          <h4>OAuth implicit flow (DEPRECATED)</h4>
          <p>
            Instead of sending an auth code back to the client, the tokens are returned directly as
            query params in the URL hash (in the hash since this isn't sent outside of the browser
            and was implemented before HTTPS was common, which would have encrypted the URL over the
            wire). This was for clients that did not have a dedicated backend, but has been
            superseded by auth code flow w/ PKCE, which is more secure.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>OIDC hybrid flow</h4>
          <p>
            This is the same as OAuth explicit flow, but an ID token is returned immediately
            alongside the auth code, so information about the user can be queried and/or associated
            with your backend's account for the user while the auth code is still being exchanged
            for tokens.
          </p>
          <p>
            NOTE: only safe to use with confidential clients because you are revealing the ID token
            to the client before providing security measures in auth code flow (like PKCE or nonce).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <!-- MARK: PKCE -->
          <h4>Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) flow</h4>
          <p>This is the same as the auth code flow, except:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Client creates a random key and supplies a hashed version to the IdP redirect via
              <code>code_challenge</code> URL param
            </li>
            <li>
              Client sends un-hashed key along with auth code to IdP auth server, which checks for
              hash match before returning tokens
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Note: PKCE doesn't guarantee that the request is legitimate; only that whoever initiates
            the flow is the only one who can finish it. It is <em>NOT</em> protection against XSS;
            it is protection from CSRF and auth code interception/injection (done via intent
            interception in mobile apps).
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: the <code>state</code> parameter does <em>not</em> provent auth code
            interception/injection on mobile because an intercepted redirect intent contains the
            <code>state</code> parameter.
          </p>

          <p>
            SPAs and mobile apps that cannot have a BFF to be the OAuth server should use PKCE for
            protection against auth code interception since these clients cannot store an OAuth
            client secret securely in the application source.
          </p>

          <p>
            PKCE can generally be included in all implementations (though
            <code>state</code> in confidential clients is acceptable too, but it requires your
            client to check for mismatched state instead of being able to rely on guaranteed failure
            of the PKCE check on the IdP auth server).
          </p>

            <h5>OAuth Security</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Use PKCE for public clients.</li>
              <li>
                If using a confidential client, either PKCE or <code>state</code> parameter must be
                used prevent CSRF. If using <code>state</code>, it must be checked in the client to
                make sure the state matches the one generated for the original auth redirect. PKCE
                will be validated by the IdP auth server.
              </li>
              <li>
                Generally include <code>state</code> parameter in any implementation because OAuth
                error responses must include them, which can avoid some attack vectors from poorly
                implemented clients (though this attack vector seems limited).
              </li>
              <li>
                If using OIDC hybrid flow, use <code>nonce</code> parameter to avoid CSRF (though
                <code>state</code> or PKCE should already handle this). <code>nonce</code>, like
                <code>state</code>, must be checked for a match on the client.
              </li>
              <li>
                Always consistently use <code>state</code> or PKCE when using both OAuth and OIDC
                flows since some downgrade attacks are possible if your client allows flows where
                PKCE/<code>state</code> and <code>nonce</code> parameter (OIDC) are mutually
                exclusive in flows.

          <h4>OAuth Public Clients</h4>
          <p>
            SPAs and mobile apps should use a BFF to be the OAuth server. 1) This allows using a
            client secret, which is more secure than PKCE, and 2) this keeps the access and refresh
            tokens stored only in an encrypted format (for mobile apps) and/or in a secure location
            (<code>HttpOnly</code> cookies for SPAs, though these should encrypt too to avoid
            compromise from network leak). Having these clients handle the tokens directly is
            susceptible to XSS (SPA) or URI redirect attacks (mobile apps).
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: an alternative is to use a session cookie (for SPAs) and store the cookies on the
            server in the session, but if so, make sure the session ID cookie is signed (via HMAC
            most likely).
