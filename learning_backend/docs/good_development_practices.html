        <h2>Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) vs Test-Driven Development (TDD)</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>BDD</strong> is from the <em>user's</em> POV and describes expectations and
          desires. <strong>TDD</strong> is from the <em>developer's</em> POV and focuses on
          implementation and functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          BDD should be used to delineate the happy path. Note unhappy paths as the branches not
          taken (to make sure unknowns are accounted for).
        </p>
        <p>
          Rapidly prototype the happy path to uncover 'unknown unkowns', which can be added to
          unhappy path enumeration.
        </p>
        <p>
          TDD should then be used to fully flesh out the happy path, followed by the unhappy paths
          by severity.
