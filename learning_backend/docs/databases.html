        <h2>SQL (Relational database management system, aka RDBMS)</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Database contains tables which contain columns, which is queried with a SQL-like
            language to return rows/records.
          </li>
          <li>Have a predefined schema, which is helpful for maintaining data consistency.</li>
          <li>
            Data <em>related</em> to a different table is usually tracked via a foreign key, which
            references the primary key for a row in a different table
          </li>
          <li>
            Related data is queried via JOIN statements which perform queries according to key
            expression across the desired tables (this is highly optimized to be performant)
          </li>
          <li>
            Some SQL DBs (like Postgres), also support JSON fields whose key-values can be indexed
            using GIN indices (Generalized Inverted Index), which are like a table of contents that
            is also implemented with B-trees ("inverted" because a single row now can appear in many
            places in the table of contents)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Organization: data determines the structure, not the queries</p>
        <p>Pros: Enforces data consistency via schema.</p>
        <p>Cons: Has more difficulty scaling horizontally than NoSQL due to JOINs.</p>

        <p>Best general choice: <strong>PostgreSQL</strong></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>NoSQL (Non-relational DB, aka document store)</h2>

        <p>
          Note: key-value store refers to a storage system where the value is an opaque string and
          only keys are indexable (like in Redis). These usually serve a different purpose than a
          traditional DB.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Database contains tables/collections which contain what are often referred to as
            documents (records), which is queried with a language dependent on the DB.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes has a predefined schema (Cassandra), but often does not, allowing for
            arbitrary document structure within the same table.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to keep data collated (located together), NoSQL DBs often use denormalization
            (duplication) of data that is unlikely to change and/or nesting sub-documents within a
            document when convenient or the data of the parent document is likely to change.
          </li>
          <li>
            This data collation prevents NoSQL DBs from needing to perform JOIN-type operations,
            which they are not optimized to do.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Organization: intended queries determine the structure, to collate the data</p>
        <p>
          Pros: Scales horizontally better than relational DBs because data for queries is located
          together and only requires querying a single record in a distributed DB
        </p>
        <p>Cons: Data consistency can become very difficult to enforce or restore if broken</p>

        <p>
          No best general choice; all depends on use case and/or ecosystem/platform you are already
          using.
        </p>
      </section>

      <p>
        Note: in both types of DBs, it is preferable to leave missing fields missing/null, rather
        than using an empty value. This is especially true for NoSQL since including the value
        requires the key name to be stored too, bloating space much more than in a relational DB.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>B-trees</h2>
        <p>
          Databases are indexed using B-trees (technically B+ trees since they have many real-world
          benefits over B-trees).
        </p>

        <p>
          B-trees are self-<strong>b</strong>alanced n-ary trees that contain large numbers of keys
          within a single node to minimize tree height and thus I/O due to disk access jumps.
        </p>

        <p>B+-trees add the following to B-trees:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only leaf nodes store data while internal nodes store keys only</li>
          <li>
            Internal nodes only store keys, means that leaf nodes must duplicate the key to go
            alongside the value
          </li>
          <li>Leaf nodes form a linked list for efficient range-based queries</li>
          <li>Very high fan-out (more children per node, 100+)</li>
          <li>
            Due to not needing to store data in internal nodes, more keys fit into a page of memory
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The benefit of a B/+-tree is that while more operations need to be performed to retrieve
          the key-value from the node that contains it (along with many other key-values), the high
          fanout means less I/O is needed to reach that correct node.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, the size of the data that fits into a node will usually be optimized to fit into the
          memory page size of the system, so operations to narrow down keys within the node are very
          fast due to all data being in contiguous memory.
        </p>

        <h2>Data lake</h2>

        <p>
          Data lakes usually store un-structured, raw data (can be coming from many sources in many
          forms for many purposes) as individual files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data lakes often store files with names/paths according to when they were uploaded to the
          lake.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time-related storage allows for processing data on a rolling or queued basis, where a
          delay in the availability of the data is not an issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data lakes can also be the store for the data after processing, often moving the data to
          an appropriate different path in the data lake; however, data lakes are not optimized for
          fast access except at the individual file level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data lakes also allow for retroactive re-processing of data by keeping all raw data, such
          as in case of ETL bugs or changed of metrics the company is interested in.
