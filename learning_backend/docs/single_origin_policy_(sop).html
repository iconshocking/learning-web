    <main>
      <h2>Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</h2>
      <p>
        An origin is defined as the combination of protocol-host-port (ex:
        'https://auth.google.com:443', where 'https' is the protocol, 'auth.google.com' is the host,
        and '443' is the port - though ports are usually implied with 443 for HTTPS and 80 for
        HTTP).
      </p>

      <p>Origin is inherited or not in certain instances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          inherited when opening <code>about:blank</code> pages, such as calling
          <code>Window.open()</code> and running a script in the new window
        </li>
        <li><code>data:</code> URLs have a new, empty security context.</li>
        <li>
          <code>file:///</code> schema usually are considered "opaque origins", which means that
          files in the same dir should not be considered from the same origin, but not all browsers
          do this, which means a locally-opened HTML file may be able to access other files on the
          user's device. (This is a security risk of browsers, not something that web devs need to
          consider.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Embedded content also respects SOP: a page with a cross-origin <code>iframe</code> has
        minimal access to its <code>Window</code>'s properties while a same-origin
        <code>iframe</code> allows full access to its DOM. The same is true when opening up popup
        documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: this is why CSRF tokens can't just be circumvented by embedding the form page first
        and pulling the CSRF token out using JS to create a usable CSRF URL. (Tangentially,
        <code>fetch()</code> requires CORS to avoid opaque responses, so that attack route is
        blocked as well.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>Origin</code> header is the context origin (i.e., the page) from where a request
        was <em>sent</em> and is present on all requests except GET/HEAD same-origin requests. Even
        if present, it can be null in various circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        The web is built off SOP, which states that resources from one origin are accessible only to
        that same origin. This provides significant security by default. The two main ways in which
        SOP is relaxed is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          CORS, which is a loosening of security by allowing your resources to be accessed from
          <em>other</em> origins.
        </li>
        <li>
          CSP, which is a tightening of security, largely to prevent XSS, by restricting which
          resources are callable by <em>your</em> origins (among other settings).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: Same-origin policy also applies to local/session storage and IndexedDB (not cookies
        though, which are just 'same-site', i.e., domain-based).
      </p>

        <h3>CORS (Cross-Origing Resource Sharing)</h3>
        <p>
          CORS defines which <em>other</em> origins can call <em>your</em> origin URLs from their
          web pages, i.e., sharing <em>your</em> resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          CORS is <em>default</em> secure: no CORS headers is equivalent to having a 'same-origin'
          policy (SOP). Adding CORS headers should always be considered as opening up a
          vulnerability that should be assessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          SOP/CORS is <em>browser-level</em> and provides no protection against direct calls to your
          origins from outside a browser: this is because while the <code>Origin</code> header is a
          'forbidden header' in the browser (meaning it cannot be set programmatically), it is
          trivially easy to spoof the value outside of a browser. However, this still provides a
          great deal of security because attacks via browser are a common vector since cookies are
          usually only sendable via the compromised victim's browser (assuming the cookies are set
          securely). For example, an evil proxy forwarding the victim's requests to your origins
          would not receive the cookies and so not be able to forward any cookies, thwarting most
          attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>NOTE:</strong> SOP/CORS thus has no mitigation against non-cookie token-based
          security. These vectors need to be handled by rate-limiting for spam and examining for
          malicious indicators.
        </p>

          <h4>CORS Headers</h4>

          <h5>On OPTIONS preflight request</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Access-Control-Request-Method</code></li>
            <li><code>Access-Control-Request-Headers</code></li>
          </ul>

          <h5>On server response</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>, which must match the origin of the request
                (annoyingly only accepts a single origin, so it is on the the server to supply the
                origin corresponding to the request)
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> do <em>not</em> set this header to the wildcard
                <code>*</code> since it allows your resources to be called from any origin.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note: also set <code>Vary: Origin</code> header if there is more than one origin
                that is allow-listed, to indicate that the response is dependent on the origin.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code>, which must match the header of any
              preflight OPTIONS request
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code>, which must match the headers of any
              preflight OPTIONS request (CORS-safe headers are not required to be listed)
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code>, which must be present in order for 1)
                a credentialed request with a preflight to be allowed to send or 2) a simple request
                to receive a non-opaque response (<code>fetch()</code> will only send credentials by
                default for <code>same-origin</code> calls)
              </p>

              <p>
                Note: credentialed calls do not allow for any CORS-response headers to be wildcard
                <code>*</code>s.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Access-Control-Expose-Headers</code>, which exposes listed headers in the
              response to the client's JS (normally only CORS-safelisted headers are accessible)
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Access-Control-Max-Age</code>, which is how many seconds the preflight request
              response can be cached (cache is per <em>request</em>, so trying to optimize the
              preflight cache has limited returns).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>CORS-requiring Contexts</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>fetch()</code> (<strong>NOTE:</strong> calls can still be made using
              <code>no-cors</code> mode, but the response will be opaque if the response doesn't
              have a matching <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header.)
            </li>
            <li>CSS web fonts</li>
            <li>CSS shapes that use images</li>
            <li>WebGL textures</li>
            <li>Image/video frames drawn to canvas using <code>drawImage()</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The latter three are because the image data can be inspected from JS, which is a
            security risk.
          </p>

          <section>
            <h5>CORS-optional Contexts</h5>
            <p>
              The <code>crossorigin</code> attribute can be set for a few elements to change the
              default call to a CORS call:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>img/video/audio</code>: data cannot be inspected via JS w/o CORS call</li>
              <li><code>script</code>: limits programmatic error logging w/o CORS call</li>
              <li>
                <code>link</code>: depending on the type of the <code>link</code> element, non-CORS
                calls will be discarded (such as for <code>"preload"</code> elements)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Attribute values <code>anonymous/use-credentials</code> determine whether cookies are
              sent in the CORS request.
            </p>
          </section>

          <p>
            Note: this means you can't prevent others hosting your media via CORS, so if that is
            needed or becomes a cost problem, consider hosting them in a non-public way, requiring a
            token to access them or something similar.
          </p>

        <section>
          <!-- MARK: preflight -->
          <h4>Preflight OPTIONS</h4>
          <p>
            Preflight OPTIONS requests will be sent automatically by the browser to the server
            before performing a non-simple CORS request, and the original request will only be sent
            if the CORS headers in the response allow for the origin, method, headers, and
            credential state of that request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Preflight requests will not be sent for 'simple' requests that have the following
            (ignoring some extra qualifiers that are not as important):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>GET/HEAD/POST</li>
            <li>
              Only some basic headers (excluding cookies, which are added to the headers by the
              browser)
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Content-Type</code> header of either one of the base form encoding types or
              <code>text/plain</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Preflight requests do not contain credentials (there are some bugs/complexities around
            TLS certs though).
          </p>

          <p>
            Note: preflight requests do not always work well with redirects in all browsers. There
            are a few options to try if running into this issue:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Change server-side response to avoid needing preflight or redirect</li>
            <li>Change client request to simple request to avoid preflight</li>
            <li>
              Make a dummy simple request to get the redirected URL, and then make the preflighted
              to the finalized URL
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Cookies and CORS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>Set-Cookie</code> will not set a cookie in the browser if a response fails due
              to CORS
            </li>
            <li>
              3rd-party cookies are blocked by default in many browsers now, so setting cookies in
              cross-origin requests will generally fail
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>SameSite</code> settings for cookies will apply, so cross-site cookies will need
              to be <code>SameSite=None</code> to be sent
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>CORS and CSRF</h4>
          <p>CORS/SOP does not prevent CSRF attacks due to the folling:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Navigation requests (GET and POST via form) are not part of SOP (since most links
                would never work then), so CORS does not apply to them.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Due to CORS backwards-compatability requirements, any simple GET/HEAD/POST request
                from a CORS-requiring context is always sent <em>without</em> a preflight OPTIONS
                request. Note: the <em>response</em> will not be successfully returned to the
                browser unless the server responds with the correct CORS headers, but the server
                will still <em>process</em> the request (because the server shouldn't enforce CORS).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <!-- MARK: CSP -->
        <h3>CSP (Content Security Policy )</h3>
        <p>
          CSP is which <em>other</em> origins can run content on <em>your</em> origins; i.e.,
          (tightening of security), locking down what you run on your page (mainly to prevent XSS
          loading malicious scripts).
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header accepts directives for which origins
          different types of content can be requested, separated by semicolons. Example:
          <code>default-src 'self'; img-src *; media-src example.org *.example.net</code>, means all
          content not specificed (such as <code>script-src</code>) can only be loaded from the
          current host, images can be loaded from any host, and media can only be loaded from the
          example.org host or example.net sub/domains.
        </p>
        <p>
          NOTE: hosts that include paths that end in '/' allow access to all subpaths (ex.:
          'example.com/api/'' will match 'example.com/api/users/new').
        </p>

        <p>
          NOTE: CSP prevents inline scripts/styles (do <em>not</em> lift this using
          <code>'unsafe-inline'</code>), and host-based CSP directives are considered less secure,
          so generally use hashes and nonces to avoid both of these issues.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Hashes and Nonces</h4>
          <p>
            The browser provides two ways to restrict loading, specific resources unless they are
            trustworthy: subresource integrity (hashes) and nonces. Generally,
            <strong>nonces are preferred</strong>, unless the integrity of the resource could be in
            question, because hashes must be calculated per-resource and have to be updated whenever
            a resource changes. This requires a lot of overhead and a more complex request header
            setup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the directive <code>'strict-dynamic'</code> allows for inherited trust by
            all resources loaded by a nonce/hash-validated resource. This prevents needing to CSP
            allow-list all additional resources that a 3rd-party script might load.
            <strong>However,</strong> it also requires all resources, including from the
            <code>'self'</code> origin, to use nonces/hashes, so this security measure must be
            implemented for all resources on the page.
          </p>

          <section>
            <!-- MARK: hashes -->
            <h5>Subresource Integrity</h5>
            <p>Note: Subresource integrity can be used by itself without CSP.</p>
            <p>
              Browsers use subresource integrity via the <code>integrity</code> attribute for script
              and link elements so that the page only receives resources if the provided hash in the
              attribute matches the hash of the fetched resource. Example:
              <code>integrity="sha384-abcd1234"</code> prevents loading the resource for that
              element if it's hash using the SHA-368 algorithm isn't "abcd1234".
            </p>

            <p>
              NOTE: subresource integrity for external resources is a newer feature for some
              browsers, so hashes should be accompanied by nonces for now (unless nonces are
              unavailable due to using static assets).
            </p>

            <p>
              This is used to allow inline scripts/links but can be difficult due to whitespace
              mattering in the hash, so automate this as part of CI when needed regularly.
              Alternatively, the debug console in browsers will usually show the hash of the
              resource that was loaded, so you can copy that into the code (just make sure the
              whitespace-stripping is the same as for prod when developing).
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <!-- MARK: nonces -->
            <h5>Nonces</h5>
            <p>
              Nonces can be defined in the CSP header via <code>'nonce-xyz123'</code>, where a
              matching <code>nonce</code> attribute must be present on the element that is loading
              the resource (or for inline script/style elements).
            </p>
            <p>
              The nonce must be crytographically random and newly generated for each request. This
              makes this non-viable for static SPA bundles.
            </p>
          </section>

          <p>
            Note: the values of the <code>integrity</code> and <code>nonce</code> attributes are not
            readable by JS, so XSS cannot extract them.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Safe root CSP policy</h4>
          <pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: 
  script-src 'nonce-abcd1234' 'strict-dynamic' https: 'unsafe-inline';
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'self';</code></pre>
          <p>NOTE: usage of either hashes or nonces overrides <code>'unsafe-inline'</code>.</p>

          <p>This is safe for a few reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>CSP-version backwards-compatability</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Browsers that support CSP3 recognize <code>'strict-dynamic'</code>, so
                  nonce-validated resources and their chained resources will be loaded.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Browsers that support CSP2 do not recognize <code>'strict-dynamic'</code>, but
                  still recognize the nonce/hash, and so will load the nonce-validated resources and
                  their chained HTTPS resources.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Browsers that support CSP1 do not recognize anything nonce/hash-related, and so
                  they will run <code>'unsafe-inline' https:</code>
                </li>
              </ul>

                NOTE: due to this policy being largely insecure on non-CSP3 browsers, you should
                narrow down hosts from all of HTTPS if you are a security-oriented application or
                expect non-trivial legacy browser traffic (pre mid-2022).

              <code>object-src 'none';</code> prevents loading any old plugins (like Flash) with
              security vulnerabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Setting <code>base-uri 'self';</code> overrides any form of HTML injection that would
              insert a <code>base</code> element into the HTML (a very unlikely attack but doesn't
              hurt).

          <h4>Static SPA CSP recommendation</h4>
          <p>
            Static SPAs can't use nonces, and remote resources do not support using hashes on some
            browsers until fairly recently, so using <code>'strict-dynamic'</code> would prevent
            loading of the SPA setup JS resources in those instances.
          </p>
          <p>
            To solve this issue, create an inline script that adds your remote script elements, hash
            that inline script, then add that hash to your CSP header.
            <code>'strict-dynamic'</code> will propagate trust to the remote resources and allow a
            static SPA to use a modern CSP.
          </p>
        </section>

        <p>
          VERY useful for testing before rollout:
          <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> allows loading of policy-conflicting
          resources, and instead a report will be sent to the specified URL in
          <code>Content-Security-Policy: report-to/uri: [your-endpoint]</code> (<code
            >report-uri</code
          >
          is deprecated, but define both for now).

        <!-- MARK: mixed content -->
        <h3>Mixed Content</h3>
        <p>Note: do <em>not</em> allow mixed content on your page.</p>

        <p>
          Mixed content is when a secure (HTTPS) web page uses resources that would be transferred
          over an insecure protocol (usually HTTP). All current browser disallow mixed content and
          will notify a user that the website is not secure before loading (same as if the page
          itself was served over HTTP).
        </p>

        <p>
          If the user continues to the site or the page dynamically attempts to load mixed content,
          the browser will do one of two things:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            upgrade the request to HTTPS (this is mainly only for media elements with
            <code>src</code> attributes)
          </li>
          <li>block the request (this is for most things that could modify the page)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Local resources are considered secure: <code>file:</code> and loopback addresses like
          <code>http://127.0.0.1</code> and <code>http://localhost</code>, which makes development
          much easier.
