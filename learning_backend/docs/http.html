      <h1>HTTP</h1>
      <p>The default protocol for HTTP is HTTP/1.1, which is a string-based protocol.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>POST creates a new resource</li>
        <li>
          PUT updates the WHOLE resource (idempotent, should think of it as overwriting ALL of what
          is already there with the new content)
        </li>
        <li>PATCH updates a resource partially</li>
        <li>DELETE removes a resource</li>
        <li>GET retrieves a resource</li>
        <li>
          HEAD retrieves just the header (maybe to check content-length before downloading a large
          file)
        </li>
        <li>
          OPTIONS is for determining capabilities of the server, most often used for CORS pre-flight
          requests
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h2>HTTP/2 (H/2)</h2>
        <p>HTTP/2 improves upon HTTP/1.1 in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>binary protocol, so uses significantly less bytes</li>
          <li>
            multiplexing multiple requests over a single TCP connection, eliminating HTTP
            head-of-line (HOL) blocking from HTTP/1.1, when a browser had used up all allowed
            connections for a domain
          </li>
          <li>
            HPACK allows header compression over TLS to be secure again (resistant to CRIME
            attacks), reducing bytes over the wire (note: HTTP/3 also allows this using QPACK header
            compression)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          HTTP/2 also implemented server push (a way to push additional resources to clients without
          them asking for them yet), but it has been removed from some modern browsers and is
          considered deprecated because it usually just wastes bandwidth since it deosn't account
          for user/CDN-cached resources.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>HTTP/3</h2>
        <p>
          NOTE: HTTP/3 is quite new (w/ no support on Safari currently) and can introduce unexpected
          complexities and monitoriting difficulties, so enable with caution.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTTP/3 uses the <strong>QUIC</strong> protocol, which changes HTTP from being over TCP to
          UDP. The reason is to support the following upgrades from HTTP/2:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Solve TCP and TLS HOL blocking:
            <ul>
              <li>
                TCP HOL blocking by changing to UDP, which doesn't require packets to arrive in
                order (so losing one just requires sending one additional packet)
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  TLS HOL blocking by changing TLS to be applied to each UDP packet, not an entire
                  TCP message like HTTP/2 (so decryption doesn't require all packets to have to be
                  received)
                </p>

                <p>Note: TLS 1.3 is embedded into QUIC, so encryption is not optional.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Fewer round trip times (RTT) to establish handshake with the server because UDP
              doesn't require a handshake like TCP does. Therefore, HTTP/3 can start requesting HTTP
              data immediately if using TLS 1.3 with 0-RTT since there is no TCP handshake or TLS
              handshake.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These changes are meant to better handle mobile connections that very often go through
          blips in connectivity, lose many packets, and change the IP address they are sending over
          when changing networks / towers.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Network handshakes and round trip times (RTT)</h2>
        <p>The standard protocol for fetching a resource from a URL, works as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>DNS lookup (but this is cached after first time)</li>
          <li>TCP handshake (1 RTT)</li>
          <li>
            TLS handshake (1 RTT over 1.3, 2 RTT over 1.2 but you shouldn't use TLS 1.2 unless for
            some reason you have to)
          </li>
          <li>HTTP resource request</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So 2 RTT + DNS before being able to process the HTTP request.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>TLS 1.3 w/ 0-RTT</strong> allows for resuming a TLS session without the added TLS
          handshake, meaning 1 RTT total (from TCP handshake) for returning user (TLS 1.2 supported
          something similar to go from 2 RTT to 1 RTT).
        </p>
        <p>
          NOTE: 0-RTT is uniquely susceptible to replay attacks because the encrypted message, if
          intercepted, can be transmitted multiple times and be completely valid, which is a concern
          for non-idempotent calls.
        </p>

        <h2>Streaming</h2>
        <p>There are a few forms of stream connections:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Long-polling: client opens a connection and the server waits until new data is available
            to send; the client restarts the connection after receiving the response (so not really
            a stream)
          </li>
          <li>
            HTML5 WebSockets (not HTTP, but over TCP): client opens a persistent connection that
            allows for bidirectional streaming with the server
          </li>
          <li>
            HTML5 Server Sent Events (SSE) / EventSource: client opens a persistent connection that
            allows for server-side streaming (incoming to client, no outgoing) - <em>always</em> use
            this over HTTP/2 to avoid eating up a usable TCP connection
          </li>
          <li>
            gRPC (not HTTP): supports uni/bidirectional streams, but is only implementable on mobile
            clients as of now (not browser)
          </li>
        </ul>
